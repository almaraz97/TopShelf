Seller Process
1. Pay ETH fee to list an item (NFT)
2. Renew listings by burning TOPs
3. Buyers pay you for owning NFTs

Buyer Process
1. Purchase items with ETH (own the NFT)
2. Get rewarded TOPs for purchases
3. Stake TOPs within listings for more TOPs

Technical details
- Listing items is by paying ETH to TopShelf contract
- Listings have a default leasing period (ei. 1 week)
- Sellers renew by burning TOPs that grant a proportionate number of seconds until lease is over (ie 1k for 1 week)
- Delinquent listings can be foreclosed on by others (?pay in tokens)
- Staking TOPs grants users 


Ideas:
Have listing transfers cost (in tokens then ?burnt)
Have listing transfer fees in tokens or ETH?
Burn or receive tokens when foreclosing/renewing? (burning helps everyone, being sent helps contract)
Have stakers rewarded tokens upon a purchase, VRF to disperse reward to staker weighted by amount staked
Creators burning tokens makes worth more which makes consumers have more which makes creators want to mint more

Adding Stake adds ?seconds, ?increases secs/TOP


Feedback system:
1. Consumers staking tokens into a listing lower renewal rate, unstaking increases rate
2. Consumers staking adds seconds to a listing (stream), unstaking..?


Tokenomics: 
Burnt when renewing listings
Burnt when foreclosing delinquent listings
Locked when staking into listings

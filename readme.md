# TopShelf
Selling Process
1. Pay ETH fee to list an item (NFT)
2. Renew listings with TOPs
3. Buyers pay you for owning NFTs

## Buying Process
1. Buy items with ETH (own the NFT)
2. Be rewarded TOPs for purchases
3. Stake TOPs within listings

## Technical details
- Listing items is by paying ETH to TopShelf contract
- Listings have a default leasing period (ei. 1 week)
- Sellers renew by burning TOPs that grant a proportionate number of seconds until lease is over (ie 1k for 1 week)
- Delinquent listings can be foreclosed on by others (?pay in tokens)
- Staking TOPs grants users 


## Ideas
Have item transfers cost (in tokens then ?burnt)
todo Have item transfer fees in tokens or ETH?
todo Burn or receive tokens when foreclosing/renewing? (burning helps everyone, being sent helps contract)
todo have stakers rewarded tokens upon a purchase, VRF to disperse reward to staker weighted by amount staked
Creators burning tokens makes worth more which makes consumers have more which makes creators want to mint more
Dynamically set reward rate per ETH by how many items are being purchased
Adding Stake adds ?seconds, ?increases secs/TOP
todo 

Tokenomics: 
Burnt when renewing listings
Burnt when foreclosing delinquent listings
Locked when staking into listings
